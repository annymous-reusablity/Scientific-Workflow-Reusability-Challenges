# Scientific-Workflow-Reusability-Challenges and actions
**Background**: Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) accelerate scientific discoveries. Scientists of diverse domains can analyze their data by constructing scientific workflows. However, even for expert users, workflow creation is a complex task due to the dramatic growth of tools and data heterogeneity. Thus, scientists attempt to reuse existing workflows shared in workflow repositories. Unfortunately, several challenges prevent scientists from reusing those workflows.

**Aims**: In this study, we thus first attempted to identify those reusability challenges. We also offered an action list and evidence-based guidelines to promote the reusability of scientific workflows.

**Method**: We collected 307 workflows from the most popular scientific workflow repository, Galaxy. Then manually analyzed to make them reusable. Next, we recorded the reusability status (reusable/nonreusable). Upon failure, we recorded the associated challenges that prevent the reusability. We also list the actions upon success.

**Results**: According to our analysis, 42.35 \% of workflows are reusable without any changes, 30.94 \% require major/minor modifications, and the remaining 26.71 \% are nonreusable. The challenges that can prevent reusability include tool up-gradation, unavailable tool support, design flaws, incomplete workflows, and failure to load a workflow.

**Conclusions**: Our intensive manual investigation examined the reusability of existing workflows and exposed several challenges. Such challenges and our action list offered guidelines to future workflow composers to create better workflows with enhanced reusability. In future, we will build a tool recommender system that assists scientists in creating reusable workflows.
